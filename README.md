Nessi
=====
Nessi is a network simulator for computer network. It is designed to simplify and speed-up the development of simulation models. As such it is mainly oriented toward educational purposes, where students can implement the most important mechanisms of current protocols with a minimum of overhead. A second application of Nessi is rapid prototyping of new protocols in order to verify the correct functioning of the protocol.
